# sonarduino
Project for TN425

Loosely based on this https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/faweiz/arduino-radar-69b8fe project.

For this implementation, the focus is placed on the interactivity of the sonar device.  By attaching
the ultrasonic sensor to a google cardboard setup, and streaming the output of the program to an android device
placed inside the cardboard, we hope to create a game of sorts.  There are multiple ways to tackle this, and as the project develops, we will comment on the changes and considerations made for this use case.
